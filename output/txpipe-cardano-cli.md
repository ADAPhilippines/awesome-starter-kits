# Cardano CLI Starter Kit

This starter kit shows how to execute common operations against the Cardano blockchain using the official command-line tool called `cardano-cli`.

## Dev Environment

For running this starter kit you'll need access to a fully synced instance of a Cardano Node and the `cardano-cli` binary.

You don't want to install the required components yourself, you can use [Demeter.run](https://demeter.run) platform to create a cloud environment with access to common Cardano infrastrcuture. The following command will open this repo in a private, web-based VSCode IDE with access to a shared Cardano Node and a pre-installed binary of the `cardano-cli`.
