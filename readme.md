## How To Use

To include your Starter Kit in <a href="http://demeter.run" target="_blank">Demeter.run</a> you need to submit a pull request to this repository with the information required to list your project.

**1.** Clone the repository

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/txpipe/awesome-starter-kits.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd awesome-starter-kits
```

**2.** Create a new branch for adding the metadata with your Starter Kit information.

```bash
# Create a new branch
$ git checkout -b starter-kit/my-awesome-starter-kit
```

**3.** Create a new folder for your Starter Kit.

```bash
# Create a new directory
$ mkdir my-awesome-starter-kit

# Go into your new feature
cd my-awesome-starter-kit
```

**4.** Add your Starter Kit metadata
   
Now you can create the file with the metadata for listing your starter kit. Metadata files are defined in <a href="https://yaml.org/" target="_blank">YAML</a> format: 

```bash
# Create a new metadata file
$ touch metadata.yaml
```

You can always copy the metadata file from another starter kit into your folder and update the information in case you don't want to generate the metadata file from scratch.

Example format for your Starter Kit metadata:
```yaml
title: Name 
logo: URL for your starter-kit logo
description: A NodeJS package that provides several examples of how to leverage Ogmios typescript client to execute local-state-queries, chain-sync and tx-monitoring operations against a node.
